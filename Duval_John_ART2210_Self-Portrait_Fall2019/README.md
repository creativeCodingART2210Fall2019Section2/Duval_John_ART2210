[PROJECT PORTAL](https://jduval7.github.io/Duval_John_ART2210/Duval_John_ART2210_Self-Portrait_Fall2019/SelfPortrait.html)


For my first Creative Coding assignment, I wanted to try and recreate myself in an interesting way.  I took some inspiration from a couple of abstract artists, and used them in a more literal way.  The first artist I used to draw inspiration from is Wassily Kandinsky.  Kandinsky was a Russian Expressionist who lived from the late 19th Century through the mid 20th.  Kandinsky loved to use color in his works and I really wanted to emulate his work “Square with Concentric Circles”.  It uses a variety of different colors to pair off of each other.  I thought it would be fun to make different circles in P5JS that would change in size and color very quickly.  This plays with scale and gives the eye something to try and analyze.  I also had the circles appear randomly across the canvas in some areas, and stay the same in others.  
The second artist I wanted to emulate a little bit is Van Gogh.  Van Gogh was a Dutch impressionist, who also live from the mid 1850s until the end of the 19th Century.  He did a variety of landscapes and still-lifes.  I wanted to incorporate the way that he had these beautiful multicolored backgrounds.  They are a variation on a few colors and they help to set a mood.  However, I wanted to go with a lighter mood than Van Gogh usually uses.  I also chose to contrast the highly abstracted background with less abstraction of the face.  
For the coding, I was able to set variables inside of functions and call those functions to make a variety of changes in the draw function.  I used for loops to make the iterated line work, and set them to rotate at the same angle as this fractal tree using a slider.  I set the animations at a specific framerate and I used push and pop functions a lot once I got going.
