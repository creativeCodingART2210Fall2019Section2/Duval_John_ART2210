# Duval_John_ART2210





[PROJECT PORTAL](https://jduval7.github.io/Duval_John_ART2210/Duval_John_ART2210_Final-Project_Fall2019/index.html)


For my final Creative Coding assignment, I wanted to try and work with an API and a JSON file.  I also wanted to implement some of the things learned throughout the semester with P5JS like motion and drawing. 

For the coding, I was able to set variables inside of functions and call those functions to make a variety of changes in the draw function.  I made requests to the openweather API to bring in weather data by City Search.  I animate a plane to takeoff from the landing strip and the to fly across the background.  When the airplane comes across the background, it pulls a random inspirational quote behind it that is taken from the JSON array I linked to it.  
I also drew a background with vectors.  
In the future I would like to implement more features, such as changing the lighting to reflect night and day.  I would also like to add different weather animations for if it is snowing/raining/etc..
