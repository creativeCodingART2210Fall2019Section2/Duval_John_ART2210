Hi, please enjoy my Soccer Game!


DIRECTIONS:  USE THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE / SPACE BAR TO SHOOT
			
			 IF YOU CROSS MID FIELD = GAME OVER

			 MORE THAN 5 BLOCKS = GAME OVER (GOALIE DOES NOT BLOCK SHOTS, ONLY OUTFIELD OPPOENTS DO)

			 40 SECONDS TO SCORE 100+ POINTS 

			 ONE GOAL = 5 POINTS

			 GOOD LUCK!!!
